[Solve Yourself Here](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/bear-and-steady-gene/problem?isFullScreen=true)

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the occurrences of each letter in the given gene string.

Then, we can use a sliding window approach to find the shortest substring that needs to be replaced.

Initially, we move the right end of the window until we have a substring that contains all the excess letters (i.e., the letters that occur more than n/4 times in the gene string).

Then, we move the left end of the window until we no longer have a substring that contains all the excess letters.

At this point, we have the shortest substring that needs to be replaced.

We repeat this process for all possible excess letters and keep track of the minimum length of the replacement substring.

Finally, we return this minimum length.
